					The overall goal is to establish a new Watersport Center at Ohio Beach right next to Navy Pier. This will bring more seasonal fun along the lake in the downtown area, especially for kids and people who are searching for a different experience in Chicago. The location and proximity to Navy Pier, provides ideal access to both locals having a day downtown and tourists visiting Chicago.  To advertise our new business, we look to social media such as Facebook and youtube, and even have our own website.
